      I love bringing ideas to life—a passion that first drew me to development
      many moons ago and continues to drive me today. I channel that drive into
      building products I respect, with careful attention to quality,
      architecture, and long-term impact.

      I'm currently a developer at Cut Direct, one of the UK's leading suppliers
      of cut-to-size materials, where I'm helping rebuild their manufacturing
      system with a strong focus on automation, streamlining processes, and
      improving efficiency.

      Outside of work, I enjoy mentoring newer developers, tinkering with side
      projects, and keeping up with the latest developments in AI. I also
      balance screen time with outdoor adventures—whether that's by the beach,
      hiking local trails, or exploring new places on the road.

      Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about tech, collaborate on a
      project, or just say hi.
