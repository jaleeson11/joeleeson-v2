      My journey into software development started in an unlikely place. Over a
      decade ago, I found myself watching The Social Network, a movie that
      portrays the founding of a little site called Facebook. Seeing Mark
      Zuckerberg's story unfold on screen, I was completely mesmerised by the
      fact that someone could bring an idea to life from nothing but code and
      vision.

      Ever since, I've been working towards where I am now, from starting out
      with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to pursuing a degree in Computer Science,
      and eventually transitioning into a full-stack software developer, still
      driven by that same inspiration today.

      I'm currently a developer at Cut Direct, one of the UK's leading suppliers
      of cut-to-size materials, where I'm helping build systems to automate
      critical business workflows such as manufacturing and procurement. Outside
      of work, I enjoy tinkering with side projects and staying current with the
      newest developments in software and AI.
